          <p>
            I'm Curtis; you'll occasionally see me go by the alias 110Percent on
            the internet. I am a frontend/backend developer currently attending
            university for a bachelor's degree in software engineering. Apart
            from development, I often enjoy playing video games, camping, anime
            and furiously configuring my desktop environment to the point of no
            return. I'm an avid GNU/Linux user (hooray for user
            control/privacy!), although I tend to use Windows 10 when playing
            games on my desktop PC. I'm also a big fan of Pok√©mon, with my
            favourite being Reuniclus, as can be clearly seen on the splash
            above.

          <h1>Video Games</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="s-content">
          <p>
            I love all sorts of video games from different genres, eras and
            publishers. I tend to kill my time in repetitive games like League
            of Legends, Counter-Strike, Smash Bros or Minecraft, although once
            in a while I tend to sink my attention into something with a nice
            story such as the Persona or Danganronpa series. I wouldn't call
            myself bad at video games by any stretch, but I tend to prioritize
            fun over skill (unless bragging rights are involved, in which case
            it's open season).

          <p>
            Programming is tied with video games for my #1 hobby. I started
            learning how to code in 2012 using Scratch, then eventually widened
            my horizons in 2015 writing bots for friends' Discord servers. Now,
            I tend to work on any project that seems interesting to me such as
            browser-based analytical applications, public informational Discord
            bots and backend plugins for modified Minecraft servers. I'm always
            looking for new problems to tackle, as well as new libraries and
            languages to add to my arsenal.
          </p>
          <p>Here's a list of languages and frameworks I am familiar with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript (The majority of my work is done here, either in the
              browser or with Node.js)
            </li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>SQL (I mainly work with the PostgreSQL implementation)</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Web languages (HTML, CSS, Pug, Sass)</li>
            <li>Bash</li>
            <li>QBASIC/Freebasic</li>
            <li>Visual Basic 6</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On top of what I already know, I'm good at learning new languages
            and libraries for whatever project I'm working on. I tend to poke
            around in other languages (Java, Ruby and Go to name a few) in order
            to get a feel for their syntax should I need to use them later.
          </p>
